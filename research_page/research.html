<h2>Research Interests</h2>
  <p>I am a mathematician who works in the field of algebraic geometry. I am currently working on the following topics. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Characteristic classes of singular spaces:<br>Singularity theory is at the crossroads of multiple mathematical disciplines. It is related to algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, combinatorics, mathematical physics, PDE, etc. Given a singular space, there exists canonically defined notable elements in its (co)homology groups. These elements delicately reflect properties of the given singular space.</li>
    <li>Free divisors:<br>These are a class of singular spaces. The general theory of free divisors has applications on the study of hyperplane arrangements. Moreover, the Hodge-theoretic aspects of free divisors are interesting.</li> 
    <li>Discriminants:<br>They often arise from the versal deformation of singularities, or from the representation of certain algebraic groups. Discriminants are often free divisors.</li> 
  </ul>
